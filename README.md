# EyDownloader
A browser script to download all pictures from the EyParent Childcare App.

## Overview
EyLog doesn’t seem to provide a way of downloading all the pictures of your child’s timeline. So I wrote a script to do it.

The script will run in a PC browser, scroll to the bottom of your child’s timeline and then give you a list of links to download, which once you download will give you lots of zip files with five pictures in them each.

This script doesn’t save the files to the cloud or do anything nefarious, but has no guarantee that it’ll work or won’t crash your browser!

Note the EyParent website is slow and buggy, so we download the pictures in batches of five because otherwise the website may crash. I’ve tested this on the Microsoft Edge browser. It’ll probably work on Google Chrome, no idea if it’ll work on a Mac.

This process might still take several hours as the site is so slow. Therefore make sure you’ve made a cup of tea and do it on a laptop or computer that you’re not going to need for a while.
